## vAccel tutorials

This repo contains a number of lab exercises that assist in the familiarization
with the vAccel framework.

The first one (`lab1`) contains instructions on how to build vAccelRT and execute
a simple operation.

The second one (`lab2`) describes the process to add a new function to vAccel
as a plugin and expose it to the upper layer framework as a generic operation
of vAccelRT.
