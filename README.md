## vAccel tutorials

This repo contains a number of lab exercises that assist in the familiarization
with the vAccel framework.

[lab1](https://github.com/nubificus/vaccel-tutorials/tree/main/lab1) contains
instructions on how to build vAccelRT and execute a simple operation.

[lab2](https://github.com/nubificus/vaccel-tutorials/tree/main/lab2) describes
the process to add a new function to vAccel as a plugin and expose it to the
upper layer framework as a generic operation of vAccelRT.

As we further develop the framework, more tutorials will be added. Stay tuned!
